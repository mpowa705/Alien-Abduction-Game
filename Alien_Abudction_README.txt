GAME RULES:

To begin a game, select '1 Player Game' from the Main Menu. Upon beginning a new game, the player takes control of the UFO. Using the lower-case w,a,s,d keys, the UFO may fly around the screen. The player begins with 3 lives indicated in the top left corner of the game screen. The player must avoid crashing into incoming planes, as well as the ground, otherwise player lives will be lost. At any time, the player may exit the game by pressing the ESC key. To score points, the player uses the SPACEBAR to shoot a beam down vertically towards the ground. Any soldiers caught with over 50% of their bodies in the scope of the beam will be beamed up. Each soldier beamed up to the UFO will award the player with 10 points. Soldiers that come into physical contact with the UFO will die, the UFO will survive but no points will be awarded. At specified user score intervals, the incoming plane speed will increase as follows:

score
----- 
0     -> plane speed = 5
200   -> plane speed = 6
500   -> plane speed = 8
1000  -> plane speed = 10
